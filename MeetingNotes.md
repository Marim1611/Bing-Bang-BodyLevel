## Meeting Highlights

### First, the basics.

- Dataset has 16 features where some are continuous and some are categorical (need special handling)
- Each record in the dataset is classified into one of four classes (body levels 1,2,3,4)
- Dataset need not be cleaned but analysis shall reveal correlation and class imbalance
- Needed is to apply at least three classification models (e.g., SVM, Logistic and Decision Trees) from those we covered in the course. We can as well include any more models whether deep learning or not.
- Any one of such models will be chosen to be the "competition's model"
- Need not implement machine learning models from scratch (just use libraries)

### Second,analysis.

- Analysis includes analyzing the data (class imbalance, covariance, feature distributions, ), analyzing the model (hyperparameters, learning theory, bias-variance, comparing with baseline models,..), for models should at least analyze the 3 main models (but more will be appreciated).
- Analysis also includes the reaction to the results from it  (SMOTE, dropping/augmenting features,...)

### Third, evaluation
- Project is out of 20 marks
- Includes code review, competition, analysis (TA-related) and presentation (Prof. related)
- Presentation summarize the analysis done and the findings (results) and is similar to what we had in the MI course
- Things that are expected to impress the professor in the presentation include: many models and analysis on all or most of them, using concepts and terminology form the course (i.e., the analysis uses, in the best case, all applicable concepts we learnt)
- The exact distribution is not known, but so far "competition" may get a significant share.

That's it, ignoring the trivial facts.
